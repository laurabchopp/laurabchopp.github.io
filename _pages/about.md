I am a medical student at the University of Michigan. I completed my PhD training under the direction of Dr. RÃ©my Bosselut in the joint [University of Pennsylvania-National Institutes of Health Immunology Graduate Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/nih-igg-partnership/). My PhD research focused on understanding the development and function of immune cells, specifically T lymphocytes. During my medical training I am performing research with Dr. Johann Gudjonsson in the Dermatology Department at the University of Michigan.
