[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://laurabchopp.github.io/files/ChoppCV_Summer2024.pdf)

I am a physician-scientist in training at the University of Michigan, currently in medical school. I completed my PhD training under the direction of Dr. Rémy Bosselut in the joint [University of Pennsylvania-National Institutes of Health Immunology Graduate Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/nih-igg-partnership/). My PhD research focused on understanding the development and function of immune cells, specifically T lymphocytes. During my medical training I am working as a bioinformatics consultant in the Dermatology Department at the University of Michigan.
