[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://laurabchopp.github.io/files/ChoppCV_Summer2024.pdf)

I am a physician-scientist in training at the University of Michigan, currently in medical school. I completed my PhD training under the direction of Dr. RÃ©my Bosselut in the joint [University of Pennsylvania-National Institutes of Health](https://www.med.upenn.edu/nih-igg-partnership/) immunology PhD program. My PhD research focused on unraveling the developmental and functional control of a type of immune cell called T lymphocytes. During my medical training I am working as a bioinformatics consultant in the Dermatology Department at the University of Michigan.
